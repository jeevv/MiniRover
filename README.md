# The Astra Rover Project

A repo containing various software utilised by Astra Robotics in our rover project

## Progress

### Tasks remaining:
1. Tuning PID constants
2. Interfacing IMU and fusing data with wheel encoders using an EKF
### Tasks completed:
1. PID control for linear velocity and angular velocity
## Issues
None :)

## Updates

### Version 1.3.0 
  -> Teleop keyboard control being used\
  -> SLAM working, accuracy issues present\
  -> Wheel encoder data being used without IMU, might be causing a loss in accuracy\
